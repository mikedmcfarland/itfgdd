Go Head to head versus a bunch of computer controlled opponents.
Each opponent comes from a different animal faction.
You'll approach them in order, one by one.
Each one increasing in difficulty.

Before each battle there will be a screen showing the opponent, as well as some one sided dialogue,
which is pretty much trash talk and some reveal as to their belief about the origin of the game.

Since this idea is pretty much ripped from warios woods here are some examples.

The characters in the scene actually animated a few frames from time to time.
It Was a subtle effect.

To help make increasing difficulty more managable, it may be worth giving the different characters special abilities.
At higher levels they could be more powerful, or earned more quickly.
